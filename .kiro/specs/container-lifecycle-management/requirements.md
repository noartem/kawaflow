# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive container lifecycle management system for Kawaflow. The system enables flow-manager to manage flow containers through their complete lifecycle (create, start, stop, restart, update, delete) while facilitating bidirectional communication via Unix socket files. Each flow container runs user-created code and communicates with flow-manager through dedicated socket files named by container ID. The flow-manager exposes these capabilities through a Socket.IO interface for real-time interaction.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create new flow containers with specific configurations, so that I can run isolated workflow instances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a create_container event is received THEN flow-manager SHALL create a new Docker container with a unique ID
2. WHEN creating a container THEN flow-manager SHALL mount a Unix socket file named `{container_id}.sock` for communication
3. WHEN creating a container THEN flow-manager SHALL configure the container with the flow service image and necessary environment variables
4. IF container creation succeeds THEN flow-manager SHALL emit a container_created event with container details
5. IF container creation fails THEN flow-manager SHALL emit an error event with failure details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to start, stop, and restart flow containers, so that I can control their execution state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a start_container event is received THEN flow-manager SHALL start the specified container
2. WHEN a stop_container event is received THEN flow-manager SHALL gracefully stop the specified container
3. WHEN a restart_container event is received THEN flow-manager SHALL stop and start the specified container
4. WHEN container state changes THEN flow-manager SHALL emit appropriate status events (container_started, container_stopped, container_restarted)
5. IF container operations fail THEN flow-manager SHALL emit error events with specific failure reasons

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to update flow container code without losing container state, so that I can deploy changes efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an update_container event is received THEN flow-manager SHALL update the container's code volume
2. WHEN updating a container THEN flow-manager SHALL preserve the existing Unix socket connection
3. WHEN update completes THEN flow-manager SHALL emit a container_updated event
4. IF the container is running THEN flow-manager SHALL restart the container after code update
5. IF update fails THEN flow-manager SHALL emit an error event and preserve the previous container state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to delete flow containers and clean up their resources, so that I can manage system resources effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a delete_container event is received THEN flow-manager SHALL stop the container if running
2. WHEN deleting a container THEN flow-manager SHALL remove the container and its associated volumes
3. WHEN deleting a container THEN flow-manager SHALL clean up the Unix socket file
4. WHEN deletion completes THEN flow-manager SHALL emit a container_deleted event
5. IF deletion fails THEN flow-manager SHALL emit an error event with cleanup status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to send messages to flow containers and receive responses, so that I can interact with running workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a send_message event is received THEN flow-manager SHALL forward the message to the specified container via Unix socket
2. WHEN a container sends a message THEN flow-manager SHALL receive it via Unix socket and emit a message_received event
3. WHEN socket communication fails THEN flow-manager SHALL emit a communication_error event
4. WHEN a container becomes unreachable THEN flow-manager SHALL emit a container_unreachable event
5. IF message format is invalid THEN flow-manager SHALL emit a message_format_error event

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor container status and receive real-time updates, so that I can track system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a get_container_status event is received THEN flow-manager SHALL return current container state and health information
2. WHEN container status changes THEN flow-manager SHALL automatically emit status_changed events
3. WHEN a list_containers event is received THEN flow-manager SHALL return all managed containers with their current states
4. WHEN container health checks fail THEN flow-manager SHALL emit container_health_warning events
5. IF a container crashes THEN flow-manager SHALL emit a container_crashed event with crash details

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging of all container operations, so that I can debug issues and audit system activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any container operation is performed THEN flow-manager SHALL log the operation with timestamp, container ID, and operation details
2. WHEN container communication occurs THEN flow-manager SHALL log message exchanges with appropriate log levels
3. WHEN errors occur THEN flow-manager SHALL log detailed error information including stack traces and context
4. WHEN container state changes THEN flow-manager SHALL log the state transition with relevant metadata
5. IF logging fails THEN flow-manager SHALL continue operation but emit a logging_error event
